## Homepage configuration : 
This configuration is very much opinionated and based on my own needs. For further needs, please refer to [the official Homepage documentation](https://gethomepage.dev/en/configs/services/)

**The main Homepage settings file is** : 
* `settings.yaml`

You'll find here the **Page blocks configuration files** :
* `bookmarks.yaml` : the bookmarks configuration file
* `services.yaml` : the services configuration file
* `widgets.yaml` : the widgets configuration file

**Additionally**, you may need to edit :
* `docker.yaml` : the docker instances configuration file
